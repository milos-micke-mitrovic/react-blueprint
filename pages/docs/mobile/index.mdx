description: Deploy your React app to iOS and Android app stores using Capacitor while keeping your existing codebase.

# Mobile

Ship your React app to the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.

import { Callout, Cards, Card } from 'nextra/components'

## Why Capacitor?

Capacitor lets you take your existing React web app and deploy it as a native mobile app. Unlike React Native, you don't need to rewrite your codebase.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Capacitor** | Keep existing React code, web-first, native access | Slightly larger bundle, WebView-based |
| **React Native** | True native UI, better performance | Complete rewrite, different paradigm |
| **PWA** | No app store needed, instant updates | Limited native access, no store presence |

<Callout type="info">Choose Capacitor if you want to maintain a single React codebase for web and mobile. Choose React Native if you're building a mobile-first app with complex native interactions.</Callout>

## What Capacitor Provides

- **Native Runtime**: Run your React app in a native WebView with full native API access
- **Native Plugins**: Camera, filesystem, push notifications, biometrics, and more
- **Live Reload**: Hot reload during mobile development
- **Web Compatibility**: Same codebase runs on web, iOS, and Android
- **Native Project Access**: Full access to Xcode and Android Studio projects

## When to Use Mobile

Consider deploying to app stores when you need:

- Push notifications
- Offline-first functionality
- Access to device hardware (camera, sensors, contacts)
- App store discoverability
- Home screen presence

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Capacitor
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli

# Initialize Capacitor in your project
npx cap init "My App" com.mycompany.myapp

# Add platforms
npm install @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android

# Build and sync
npm run build
npx cap sync

# Open native IDEs
npx cap open ios      # Opens Xcode
npx cap open android  # Opens Android Studio
```

## Project Structure

After adding Capacitor, your project will have:

```
my-react-app/
├── src/                    # Your React code
├── dist/                   # Build output
├── ios/                    # Native iOS project
│   └── App/
│       └── App/
│           └── capacitor.config.json
├── android/                # Native Android project
│   └── app/
│       └── src/
└── capacitor.config.ts     # Capacitor configuration
```

## Requirements

| Platform | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| iOS | macOS, Xcode 14+, Apple Developer account ($99/year) |
| Android | Android Studio, JDK 17+, Google Play Console ($25 one-time) |
