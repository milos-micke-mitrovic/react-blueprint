# Introduction

Welcome to **ReactBlueprint** — a comprehensive guide to building scalable React applications with modern patterns and best practices.

## What is ReactBlueprint?

ReactBlueprint provides:

- **16 comprehensive sections** covering everything from project structure to accessibility

## Who is this for?

- Teams starting new React projects
- Developers looking to standardize their codebase
- Engineers wanting to learn modern React patterns

## Quick Start

1. **[Tech Stack](/docs/getting-started/tech-stack)** — Review our recommended technologies
2. **[Project Structure](/docs/getting-started/project-structure)** — Set up your directory layout
3. **[Naming Conventions](/docs/naming/files-folders)** — Establish consistent naming

## Core Sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/tech-stack) | Tech stack and project setup |
| [Naming](/docs/naming/files-folders) | File, folder, and code naming |
| [Components](/docs/components/component-types) | Component architecture |

## Philosophy

This guide is **opinionated by design**. The patterns presented here are based on real-world experience building production React applications at scale.

We believe that:
- Consistency is more important than personal preference
- Simplicity beats cleverness
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Convention reduces cognitive load

Start with the [Tech Stack](/docs/getting-started/tech-stack) section to begin.
