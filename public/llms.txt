- Testing with Vitest and React Testing Library
- Error handling and Error Boundaries
- Performance optimization (React.memo, code splitting, lazy loading)
- Tailwind CSS styling and theming
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Git workflow, branch naming, and conventional commits
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth, protected routes)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- SEO for React apps (meta tags, Open Graph, Core Web Vitals)
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Monitoring and error tracking
